# Overview

This is a clone of the JavaScript apps from `app.bhffer.com`.

The files listed here serve two purposes.
1. When uploaded to GitHub, the CSS and JS files can be used in jsDelivr CDN directly.
2. This project is part of GitHub Pages, so the HTML files can be viewed directly through `https://prgwrtr.github.io/cdn/app/my-app.html`, for example
[redir.html](https://prgwrtr.github.io/cdn/app/redir.html)

For security reason, don't copy sensitive information to this directory.
Also don't copy `README.md` here.
